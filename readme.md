-------------------Game play Rules-------------
  - Dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in "hole card" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack.
  - Starting with 2 deck of cards.
  - Splice the used cards out after each turn.
  - Pick random cards from the remaining.

Bond starts with a $700k buy in and needs to get to $2M to win
  Winning case:
    - You win Mr. Bond - case: dealer bust
    - You win Mr. Bond - case: higher count
